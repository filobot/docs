# About the module

This module will allow you to set or reset the Filo's language; this will affect all current and future commands, modules and systems.

# Getting Started

Before proceeding with this article, you must take into account a series of elements that can influence when you are going to carry out any action described on this page:

- Filo requires the following basic permissions: ``VIEW_CHANNEL``, ``SEND_MESSAGES``, ``EMBED_LINKS``, ``USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS``, ``READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY`` and ``ADD_REACTIONS``.

- You need ``ADMINISTRATOR`` permission to perform most of the actions in this article.

- You should replace <kbd>f!</kbd> with the current prefix you have set. More information on how to change the prefix by **[clicking here](en/modules/prefix)**.
