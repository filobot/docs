# Steps to set the message type

## **Step 1**: Set the message type

To set the message type you must execute the following command: <kbd>f!config farewells set type \<Normal/Embed></kbd>.

> Don't include ``<>`` when you're running the command.
{.is-warning}

**Example**: <kbd>f!config farewells set type embed</kbd>.

## **Step 12**: Set the embed color (optional)

Currently Filo doesn't have a command to set the embed color, however there is a way to change it. When Filo is going to send the farewell message through an embed, it obtains the information of the highest role assigned to it. If said role has a custom color, the color of the embed will be the same as said role.
